# 🎓 Coursera Certificates Viewer

This is a Streamlit app that allows you to view your Coursera certificates. The app displays all the PNG images in the `img/` directory. It also shows the total number of certificates you have and the unique institutions they're from. You can select a certificate from the sidebar, and the selected certificate will be displayed in the main area of the app or view all the certificates in a table.
